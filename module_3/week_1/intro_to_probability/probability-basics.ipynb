    "> Adequate prediction of the concrete bridge deck deterioration rate is necessary for maintenance and rehabilitation decisions. The stochastic deterioration of bridge decks can be most accurately modeled with a time-based probabilistic approach. In this work, a semi-Markov time-based model, based on accelerated failure time (AFT) Weibull fitted-parameters, was used to estimate the transition probabilities and sojourn times for the deterioration of concrete bridge decks. Approximately 30 years of in-service performance data for over 22,000 bridges in Pennsylvania were used in the model development. The proposed approach attempts to relate deck deterioration rates to various explanatory factors, such as structural system attributes, average daily traffic (ADT), route type, and environmental conditions. The following factors were found to be statistically significant with respect to the rate of bridge deck deterioration: type of rebar protection, continuous versus simply supported spans, overall bridge deck length, number of spans, bridge location, type of overlay, and whether or not the deck was located on interstate routes. Furthermore, the effects of remediation on bridge deck deterioration and service life were also evaluated and quantified, based on in-service performance data.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Occupancy has significant impacts on building performance. However, in current building performance simulation programs, occupancy inputs are static and lack diversity, contributing to discrepancies between the simulated and actual building performance. This paper presents an Occupancy Simulator that simulates the stochastic behavior of occupant presence and movement in buildings, capturing the spatial and temporal occupancy diversity. Each occupant and each space in the building are explicitly simulated as an agent with their profiles of stochastic behaviors. The occupancy behaviors are represented with three types of models: (1) the status transition events (e.g., first arrival in office) simulated with probability distribution model, (2) the random moving events (e.g., from one office to another) simulated with a homogeneous Markov chain model, and (3) the meeting events simulated with a new stochastic model. A hierarchical data model was developed for the Occupancy Simulator, which reduces the amount of data input by using the concepts of occupant types and space types. Finally, a case study of a small office building is presented to demonstrate the use of the Simulator to generate detailed annual sub-hourly occupant schedules for individual spaces and the whole building. The Simulator is a web application freely available to the public and capable of performing a detailed stochastic simulation of occupant presence and movement in buildings. Future work includes enhancements in the meeting event model, consideration of personal absent days, verification and validation of the simulated occupancy results, and expansion for use with residential buildings.\n",

    ">Among engineers, risk is defined as a product of probability of the occurrence of an undesired event and the expected consequences in terms of human, economic, and environmental loss. These two components are equally important; therefore, the appropriate estimation of these values is a matter of great significance. This paper deals with one of these two componentsâ€”the assessment of the probability of vessels colliding, presenting a new approach for the geometrical probability of collision estimation on the basis of maritime and aviation experience. The geometrical model that is being introduced in this paper takes into account registered vessel traffic data and generalised vessel dynamics and uses advanced statistical and optimisation methods (Monte Carlo and genetic algorithms). The results obtained from the model are compared with registered data for maritime traffic in the Gulf of Finland and a good agreement is found.\n",

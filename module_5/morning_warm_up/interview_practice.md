### For today's warmup, we are going to practice a few common interview questions! Pair up and alternate who asks (interviewer) and who answers (interviewee) each question, then discuss the answers together afterward!

1. How do decision tree and random forest algorithms differ? What are some pros and cons of these algorithms when compared against each other? And when compared against other machine learning models?

2. Given this confusion matrix, calculate accuracy, misclassification rate, recall (aka True Positive Rate), and specificity (aka True Negative Rate).

|  | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
|---|---|---|
| Actual 0| 72| 14 |
| Actual 1| 22| 92 |


3. The smallest number divisible by 1 through 10 is 2520. Code out how to find the smallest number divisible by 1 through 20.

4. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING in a SQL query? What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

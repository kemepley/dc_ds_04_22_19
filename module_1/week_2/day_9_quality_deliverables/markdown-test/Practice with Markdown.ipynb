    "The goal of this analysis is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in a given city in Australia, based on today's weather. We analyzed a Kaggle dataset of (daily weather data <- bold 'daily weather data' and delete everything else in the parentheses!) collected in 49 Australian cities between 2010 and 2018. The final model had an 83.9% accuracy rate in predicting whether or not it would rain tomorrow vs. a baseline model accuracy of 77.8%.

    "\n",
    "Our goal is to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow, in a given city in Australia, based on today's weather, using replicable machine learning techniques. We used two separate modeling techniques (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to create these forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on this Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package of daily weather data collected in 49 Australian cities between 2010 and 2018. The dataset consists of 22 numerical and categorical features, and 1 target classification variable.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "We had duplicate data, missing values, and impossible values that we had to rectify before proceeding to modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We found some signficant correlations in our data that we had to explore further.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis used both Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create multiline Python code with syntax highlighting:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "            model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()\n",
    "        else : \n",
    "            model = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a confusion matrix to calculate classification metrics using the sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix() method.\n",

### Import packages
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`import numpy as np`

`import seaborn as sns`

### 1. Create binomial distribution variables
`use numpy binomial`

### 2. Plot (once with matplotlib and once with seaborn) and play with parameters to get normal dist. - report the parameters from which normal distribution works.

###  3. [optional - theortical] Central limit theorem from binomial distribution
 - reminder: binomial is a sum of bernouli dist. variables.
 - can you explain why will the plot look like 	normal? write down the explanation and share with	a peer (after review share with TCF)
